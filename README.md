# Moin! 👋🏻
That's how you say hello in my homeland, northern Germany. I'm 16 years old and currently attending a gymnasium (German equivalent to High School/College). After graduating next year, I'm planning on studying applied computer sciences.

## About me
Programming has been my passion since I was only 11 years old. Currently, I'm working on the Minecraft server https://skycave.de, where I mainly write plugins in Java and Kotlin.
