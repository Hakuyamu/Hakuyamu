# Moin! 👋🏻
That's how you say hello in my homeland, northern Germany. I'm 17 years old and currently attending a gymnasium (German equivalent to High School). After graduating this year, I'm planning on studying computer science.

## About me
Programming and computers have been my passion since I was 11 y/o. I'm a hobby web developer and unsalaried game developer for SkyCave.de, where I write Minecraft plugins in Java & Kotlin. My current interests are App development, messaging services and Java backend technologies.
