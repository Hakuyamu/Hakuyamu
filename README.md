# Moin! 👋🏻
That's how you say hello in my homeland, northern Germany. I'm 17 years old and currently attending a gymnasium. In a few months, I'm going to start a dual trainee in applied computer science.

## About me
Programming and computers have been my passion since I was 10 years old. I'm a software developer and unsalaried game developer for SkyCave.de, where I write Minecraft plugins in Java & Kotlin.
