# Moin! 👋🏻
That's how you say hello in my homeland, northern Germany. I'm 16 years old and currently attending a gymnasium (German equivalent to High School/College). After graduating next year, I'm planning on studying applied computer sciences.

## About me
Programming and computers are my passion since I was 11 y/o. I'm a hobby web developer and unsalaried game developer for SkyCave.de, where I write Minecraft plugins in Java & Kotlin. My current interests are App development, messaging services and Java backend technologies.

### 🔨 Working on
- A simple messenger called "WhatsFlat"
- My portfolio website

### 📖 Learning
- ElectronJS
- PostgreSQL

### 💭 Interested in
- Writing Android Apps using Kotlin
- Cryptography (creating an own password manager some day)
